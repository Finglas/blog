A few weeks back I stumbled across a tweet which I unfortunately cannot
find to give credit to. It talked about the benefit of keeping a
developer diary.

At the same time I was reading [Getting Things Done
(GTD)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-free-Productivity/dp/0749922648).
I felt inspired to take note of everything related to development that I
do during my day to day time. This would satisfy the criteria I had for
my GTD system, along with trying to emulate the success the original
tweet was referring to.

I don't have a fancy system. Rather I have a text file that is
distributed between the numerous desktops and laptops I have access to.
Here the file is synced, so I should always be up to date. Dropbox
handles this for me.

Each day I simply make a note of anything I think "*I must remember
that*" or anything that happens to be useful, interesting or new. There
is no complex system to this in order to keep in aligned with GTD, new
points are simply appended at the bottom of the file. At the end of each
week I simply group up related notes. For example, if I've got a few
bullet points about databases, I move these to fit under a "Database"
heading. [This system works for now, though I might have to re-asses
this in the
future](http://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2016/02/why-you-need-developer-diary.html).
An example of the file is below.

The most surprising thing about this, is that even on a dull day I
absorb a lot of "stuff" related to development. Equally surprising is
how awful my memory is regarding it. If I skim across the document now,
I'm alarmed at the stuff that I would have forgotten had I not taken a
note. It's quite possible that I would remember some of this information
in the long term, but regular skim readings of the diary is proving very
helpful.
