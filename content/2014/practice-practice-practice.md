The final part of my "[4 years as a Dev
series](http://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2013/04/3-years-at-codeweavers.html)"
has the same conclusion as the [last set of retrospective
posts](http://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2011/08/ten-things-graduate-will-experience.html).

Continuous learning, practice and improvement is required.

-   Books
-   Blogs
-   Videos
-   Twitter
-   Conferences

All of these mediums help, but as I've said before, practice, practice,
practice.
