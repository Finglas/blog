Meetings are hard when some team members are remote and are physically
based in the same location.

It is easy for the remote user to feel second class in terms of the
meeting. Remote workers can find it hard to add to the meeting without
interrupting or getting left behind.

One practice to balance the process of remote meeting is to ensure that
**if one or more parties are remote, all participants remote into
meeting**.

#### Benefits

-   Levels playing field - everyone should have equal opportunity to
    contribute.
-   Removes lag - everyone has the same experience of time/delay.
-   Includes online benefits such as message logs, sharing of screen.
-   Comfort of own desk/environment.

This idea was taken from [Stack Exchange's
post](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/02/why-we-still-believe-in-working-remotely/)
detailing why they still believe in remote working.
