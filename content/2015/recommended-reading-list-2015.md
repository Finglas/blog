In a similar manner to
[previous](http://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/01/recommended-reading-list-2014.html)
[years](http://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2012/10/recommended-reading-2012.html)
here is my recommended reading list for 2015. As before some of these
books have been released for a while, but these are some of my
highlights for various reasons.

#### Code

[Dependency Injection in .NET](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dependency-Injection-NET-Mark-Seemann/dp/1935182501)
:   I had put off reading this book for a while despite numerous teams
    having a copy. It turns out a good chunk of the book is applicable
    to any language, with the later third being dedicated to actual .NET
    solutions. The other two thirds of the book has expanded my
    understanding of DI.

[Effective Java: A Programming Language Guide](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Effective-Java-Programming-Language-Series-ebook/dp/B00B8V09HY)
:   Many developers recommend this book even for non Java development.
    Many of the tips and advice included we not new to myself but the
    book provided further insight and explanation. A good summary of
    best practices for any OO developers.

[Web Application Security, A Beginner's Guide](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Web-Application-Security-Beginners-Guide-ebook/dp/B006DVPWX0)
:   A good introductory book on security which provided a useful
    refresher for myself as well as providing a platform for further
    research on some of the key areas and topics.

[Enterprise Integration Patterns](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Addison-Wesley-ebook/dp/B007MQLL4E/)
:   A useful sequel to expand on Patterns of Enterprise Application
    Architecture. This book focuses more on messaging concepts, going
    into detail on a number of topics. The content of the book is
    expressed in technology agnostic terms, which has been incredibly
    useful when applied to actual implementations.

[REST API Design Guidelines](http://www.amazon.co.uk/REST-Design-Rulebook-Mark-Masse-ebook/dp/B005XE5A7Q)
:   Much of the guidelines in here fall into the category of common
    sense or industry experience. Despite this the guidelines provide
    great justifications for API design. An essential reference for any
    REST API.

[57 Exercises for Programmers](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Exercises-Programmers-Challenges-Develop-Coding-ebook/dp/B0170Q50LK)
:   A highly practical book in the sense that the book is full of over
    sixty practical tasks. Many of these fall into code katas which are
    ideal for learning new languages or just staying sharp.

[Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-ebook/dp/B0096BYG7C)
:   Despite the name this book applies to OO development in general
    while the examples use Ruby. The ideas and concepts expressed in
    this book have changed my view on OO programming. If anything the
    book will make you think differently about how to design and develop
    solutions.

[Fifty Quick Ideas To Improve Your Tests](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fifty-Quick-Ideas-Improve-Tests-ebook/dp/B00XVFFK7E)
:   A light read with each chapter dedicated to a single, focused topic.
    Many of the ideas are well known practices but with expanded
    justifications and recommendations.

[HTTP The Definitive Guide](http://www.amazon.co.uk/HTTP-Definitive-Guide-Guides-ebook/dp/B0043D2EKO)
:   The guide to HTTP if you are a developer. Each area is explained
    from high level concepts down to the nitty gritty details.

#### Process

[Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development-Addison-Wesley-ebook/dp/B00HNB3VQE)
:   A great summary of applying lean concepts to software development.
    Much of the content is familiar though the ideas applied to software
    development makes this book stand out. This acts as a useful
    refresher for lean processes as well.

[The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Startup-Innovation-Successful-Businesses-ebook/dp/B005PR422K)
:   One of the most inspirational books I've read this year. Full of
    useful and tested practices that has changed my perspective on
    beginning a startup. Interestingly much of the advice can be applied
    to individuals working within larger organizations on smaller
    projects.
