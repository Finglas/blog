#### January

-   Started the year with reasons as to why [technical blogging is
    useful and
    recommended](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/01/why-technical-blogging.html).
-   Kick started a series of posts themed around simplicity,
    recommending to [abstract data use and not data
    access](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/01/abstract-data-use-not-data-access.html).

#### February

-   A [series of posts on
    abstractions](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/02/abstractions.html).
-   The power of [Value Objects as a key
    refactoring](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/02/value-object-refactoring.html).

#### March

-   Concluded the series on abstractions.
-   The [Dependency Elimination
    Principle](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/03/dependency-elimination-principle.html)
    and [Reused Abstraction
    Principle](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/03/reused-abstraction-principle.html)
    have been two of the biggest changes I've made in my coding habits
    this year.

#### April

-   A follow up to one of my previous posts around the [use of getters
    and
    setters](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/04/getters-and-setters-are-evil-redux.html).
-   I realised I had [failed at maintaining and managing
    URIs](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/04/cool-uris-dont-change.html)
    for the content on the site.
-   The end of the month saw a focus on two simple topics that can
    [clean up duplication in
    tests](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/04/dry-vs-damp-in-tests.html)
    and [remove obscurity from
    assertions](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/04/randomly-generated-values-in-tests.html).

#### May

-   A focus on [tasking and planning in software
    development](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/05/tasking-in-software-development.html).
-   Two core techniques of producing a [Walking
    Skeleton](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/05/walking-skeleton.html)
    and [Mob
    Programming](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/05/mob-programming.html)
    have proved invaluable.

#### June

-   Provided two techniques that allow continuous delivery of software
    thanks to [feature
    toggles](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/06/feature-toggles.html)
    and [branching by
    abstraction](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/06/branch-by-abstraction.html).
-   The [question of whether or not you actually need a
    microservice](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/06/do-you-really-need-microservice.html)
    also came up.

#### July

-   The [value in integration testing was
    highlighted](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/07/integration-tests.html),
    along with an introduction into [contract
    testing](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/07/the-benefits-of-contract-testing.html).
-   The month concluded with a key reminder of [how important manual
    testing
    is](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/07/you-still-need-manual-tests.html).

#### August

-   Began with [an alternative to complex mocking
    frameworks](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/08/why-i-dont-like-mocking-frameworks.html).
-   The [use of message
    queues](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/08/queue-centric-work-pattern.html)
    is one of the biggest changes in my software development process of
    the last few years.
-   The month concluded with the acceptance that high quality
    [production code is often considered
    dirty](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/08/production-code-is-dirty.html).

#### September

-   This year the concepts and ideas in [Release
    It](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/09/release-it-highlights-part-1.html)
    have proved incredibly useful.
-   A key principle I have applied this year is to [write less
    code](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/09/waste-write-less-code.html),
    truly following the benefits of DRY and KISS.
-   The use of the [self shunt
    pattern](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/09/the-self-shunt-test-doubles-without.html)
    was provided as a simply testing strategy.

#### October

-   [Abstractions in code and details in
    metadata](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/10/abstractions-in-code-details-in-metadata.html)
    is one of the many pieces of advice the Pragmatic Programmer
    highlights.
-   Another big change in my coding habits this year has been the focus
    of [header interfaces vs role
    interfaces](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/10/header-interfaces-vs-role-interfaces.html).
-   The use of [Set Based
    Design](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/10/set-based-design.html)
    stands out as one of the most thought provoking idea of this year.
-   The month concluded with a summary of what [coding in the real
    world](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/10/coding-in-real-world.html)
    is.

#### November

-   [Pre-Computation](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/11/pre-computation.html)
    is a simple and incredibly effective solution to improve performance
    and reduce complexity.
-   The lack of the ability to [iterate upon
    architecture](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/11/you-cannot-iterate-upon-architecture.html)
    was acknowledged.
-   The month ended with two odd, but valuable lessons - [try not to
    build
    anything](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/11/dont-build-thing.html)
    and make sure you [throw code
    away](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/11/throw-code-away.html).

#### December

-   December closed out with a look back at the [anti if campaign from
    another
    perspective](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/12/reducing-conditional-logic-to-single.html).
-   The month ended with a round up of some of my [best reads of the
    last twelve
    months](https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/12/recommended-reading-list-2015.html).
