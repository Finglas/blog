Spikes are one of the best ways to aid the design of software. In some
cases spike solutions can open more questions than they solve. The use
of a technique known as *Best of Breed* can assist when this arises.

Rather than producing a single spike, produce several. Either
individually or with other developers working on a spike each. Each
solution can then be compared and contrasted. The best parts of each
solution can then be combined. Best of Breed is named for its likeness
to genetics where the best genes win out for future generations as part
of the process of evolution.

#### Example

Spike solution A has an excellent way to handle future requirements due
to the open and closed approach taken. Solution B solves the data access
problem in an elegant manner. Both solutions have good components.
Simply combine the solutions into a single approach. This results in
code that contains extensibility and good data access patterns.

#### Benefits

-   Neither standalone solution would have been as good as this hybrid
    or best of breed.
-   Multiple developers have intimate knowledge of the code thanks to
    collective code ownership.
-   Allows experimentation - go wild with multiple solutions trying out
    techniques or ideas you would not normally experiment with. Safe in
    the knowledge there is more than one solution to any problem.
-   Provides a learning platform. It's always good to see how and why
    others solve problems.

Best of Breed provides benefits above and beyond traditional spike
solutions. With more than one developer the addition of multiple spikes
can be developed in parallel. For individuals the construction of
further solutions should be evaluated on a case by case basis. Single
developers may prefer to evolve a single spike during various phases.
