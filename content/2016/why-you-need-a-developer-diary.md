After eighteen months of use, I can safely claim [how useful a a
developer diary is, and why you should start using
one](http://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2014/09/developer-diaries.html) if
you don't already.

#### Changes

Using a single file grew too large as expected. Instead each grouping is
allocated an individual file. While some of these are small, the ability
to navigate easily is not lost. The simplest thing to do here is just
point a browser at the directory. Navigation and searching is then built
in. Each week I actively split the main file file into separate files or
merge to existing content.

#### Uses

I'm increasingly finding regular needs and uses to refer back to notes.
In some cases it is quicker than searching online, simply hit the
bookmark and start typing.

Adding notes works great when reading books or watching videos. All
content recorded ends up in the same location.

#### Do It

Keeping a developer diary is without doubt one of the most useful
changes to my development process. Encouragingly others are doing
similar things too, but [under slightly different
names](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).
