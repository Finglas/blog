I have been using the incredibly simple techniques within [Getting
Things Done (GTD)](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) to good effect over
the last twelve months.

### The System

At a high level the system consists of buckets, grouping and a task
store. The actual implementation of GTD systems is down to personal
preference. Many find their system changes and evolves over time.

#### Buckets

Have one or more *buckets* which act as simple dumping grounds for
anything you need to do. My phone, pen and paper and post it notes are
the three core buckets I use.

Buckets are where you store anything that takes more than a couple of
minutes to do. If something takes less time, just do it there and then.
Regularly empty the buckets and assign them to groupings of related
items. Example groupings include tasks around the house, work projects,
blog items, or items to buy.

#### Grouping

Each grouping can then be allocated a priority. Each grouping
essentially becomes a mini kanban board.

Grouping is preferred to having one big todo list as different scenarios
allows the act of tackling items when the time is right. If you have
thirty minutes to spare on the computer, anything that can be done via
the PC can be worked on. Likewise if the weather is good, what tasks can
I do outside?

#### Trello

I use [Trello](https://trello.com/) for the storing of tasks. Trello has
the added benefit of being able to assign due dates, notes and comments.
The boards also make priorities visible. The more tasks in a column, the
more to do and potentially the more attention a certain grouping should
be given.

Daily one or more emails land in my inbox after being filtered. These
are tasks that need doing within the next twenty four hours. These are
simply reminders or *tickles* to complete a task by a set date.

#### Day to Day

GTD has been a great assistance not just in software development, but
day to day life in general. There is more to GTD but the core system is
very simple yet highly effective.

One of the biggest benefits of GTD is the ability to clear you mind. As
everything is recorded or waiting in a bucket nothing gets forgotten.
Instead you can focus on exactly what you need to be doing at the time.

In part the use of GTD is partly responsible for the growth of this blog
from 2014 to present.
