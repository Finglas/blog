Having wrote about the [top ten things I discovered in my first year at
Codeweavers](http://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2011/08/ten-things-graduate-will-experience.html),
I figured it would be time for a follow up after the past two years. In
no particular order, a collection of the biggest lessons I have
experienced.
