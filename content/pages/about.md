Authors: Shaun Finglas

I'm a software developer based in Birmingham, UK. currently working at asos as a senior software engineer. I graduated from Staffordshire University in 2010 with a degree in Computer Games Programming. I've been blogging since 2010 - though this was my second attempt after a failure back around 2008. My background is agile development and pragmatic software development. When I'm not coding I'm a keen gamer and gardener.
