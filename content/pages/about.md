Title: About Me
Slug: about
Authors: Shaun Finglas

I'm a software developer based in Birmingha, UK. I'm currently working at Asos as a Lead Software Engineer. I graduated from Staffordshire University in 2010 with a degree in Computer Games Programming.

I've been blogging since 2010 - though this was my second attempt after a failure back around 2008. My background is agile development and pragmatic software development. When I'm not coding I'm a keen gamer and gardener.
