</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>A fast, automated suite of unit and integration tests are not enough. At
some point you'll need to test your presentation logic. Ideally your
domain/business/game logic is stubbed so all you'll need to do at this
point is check that the presentation is complete. For example, does view
X load view Y? Does an error message appear when an error is raised?</p>
<p>With web sites and web applications the standard tool to use is the
excellent <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>. The problem with UI
tests in Selenium is they are often slower to write. Not only this the
maintenance cost of such tests can often be much more expensive that
other styles of tests. If the cost of such tests is high, the likely
hood of developers writing UI tests is low. In my experience there are
three types of UI tests in use.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Low Level</h3>
<p>Here UI tests are wrote directly against Selenium. This low level
approach means tests are scattered with assertions and UI details.
For example element locators such as divs and ids will be used with
methods on the Selenium driver in question. Despite this low level
approach such tests are often quick and dirty to create. The
downside to this style of test is that as the volume of tests
increase, the cost of maintenance can become very costly. A simple
UI change can cause a ripple that will cascade through many test
cases.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/Finglas/aae1cd850fc37403dbb8.js"></script>
-   ### Browser Abstraction</p>
<p>The next level up from direct use of Selenium's driver is to create
a facade around the browser or UI itself. For example rather than
duplicating the steps to log in within each test you could create a
method <code>PerfromLogin(...)</code> which each test could make use of.
Another example would be abstracting messier details of UI
automation such as clicking a button and waiting for an event. This
style of test has the benefits of low level tests but gives some
flexibility when it comes to maintenance. The downside with this
facade approach is that UI changes can still cause havoc, as each
test in question will be tied to the UI elements directly.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/Finglas/1063a11c30bc3e7290d8.js"></script>
-   ### Page Objects</p>
<p>Taking the browser abstraction to the next level, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects">page objects are
an abstraction over the UI
itself</a>. These
high level tests are wrote in terms of the domain, rather than
implementation details. There is of course one place where each page
object is bound to a UI element, but as each test uses an object,
rather than element locators you only have to change one place when
your UI changes. Unlike the previous two styles of tests, page
objects incur the most amount of code, though for more than a
handful of tests this style of UI acceptance test will pay for
itself in no time.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/Finglas/6d512240848359c12bc2.js"></script>
With the above example the <code>LogInPage</code> object will be bound to UI
locators. This will vary based on programming language, but using
C# as an example each property would have a specific attribute to
link up each element. The domain specific methods such as <code>Username</code>
will fill in the correct UI element with the provided value. By
writing the objects in a fluent interface style, you can achieve QA
friendly tests which are easy to debug when they go wrong.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A more fleshed out <a href="https://github.com/Finglas/Playground/blob/master/PageObjects/PageObjects/PageObjects.cs">example of the Page Object pattern can be found on
Github</a>.</p>
<p>Choose a style based on context. Given more than a handful of tests then
page objects are worth the extra cost, the ability to evolve your UI
while maintaining end to end tests is worth some additional complexity
at first.</p>
