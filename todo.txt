3. Set each post slug to use yyyy/mm/slug format and set tags, and dates for older categories (2014 and less).

    - Search for ../../ and fix dodgy links?

4. Setup archives "/archive.html" by default.

5. Default category is "misc", can we default this to something better?

6. Theme selection, something modern, clean and mobile friendly.
    - Use default theme "Not my idea", but modifiy the markup and CSS tweaks. Store this in a git repo.

7. Paging for homepage, max 50?
