TODO:

1.1 Second pass, make sure year categories match what is live on the blog. Post 2014 will be wrong.
    2. 2015
    3. 2016
2. Reduce tags to minimal, see output tag folder for all.
3. Set each post slug to use yyyy/mm/slug format and set tags, and dates for older categories (2014 and less).
4. Setup archives "/archive.html" by default.
5. Default category is "misc", can we default this to something better?
6. Theme selection, something modern, clean and mobile friendly.
    - Use default theme "Not my idea", but modifiy the markup and CSS tweaks. Store this in a git repo.
